# Integration Tests EKS Provisioning

This folder contains Terraform automation code to provision the following:

- **AWS VPC**
- **AWS EKS Cluster** - 2 worker managed nodes (m5.large)

### Prerequisites

- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) - `~> aws-cli/2.4.28`
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) - `~> v1.0.5`
- [`kubectl`]() - Kubectl must be installed on the host that you run `terraform` from.

## Configuration

Before provisioning set the following environment variables:

- `TF_VAR_region` - AWS region where you want to provision the cluster.
- `TF_VAR_test_name` - This is a prefix that will be applied to all provisioned resources (i.e. `your_name`).

### Example configuration 

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
export TF_VAR_region=eu-central-1

export TF_VAR_test_name=3d5f6a67b
```

## Provision the cluster

1. Clone the project
```bash title="Clone the project"
git clone git@github.com:mondoohq/mondoo-operator.git
```

2. cd into the terraform folder
```
cd .github/terraform/aws
```

3. Initialize the project (download modules)

```
terraform init
```

4. Check that everything is ready

```
terraform plan
```

5. Apply the configuration

```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Once the provisioning completes you will see something like this:

```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 81 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

cluster_arn = "arn:aws:eks:eu-central-1:735798807192:cluster/3d5f6a67b-int-tests-bpke-cluster"
cluster_certificate_authority_data = "..."
cluster_endpoint = "https://...eks.amazonaws.com"
cluster_id = "..."
cluster_name = "..."
cluster_status = "ACTIVE"
region = "eu-central-1"

```

## Connect to the cluster

After Terraform finishes provisioning, set your kube config:
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig
```

Then you can connect to your EKS cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
NAME                                       STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-10-0-5-7.us-east-2.compute.internal     Ready    <none>   6m14s   v1.21.5-eks-9017834
ip-10-0-6-242.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   6m6s    v1.21.5-eks-9017834
```

## Running integration tests

After setting up the cluster via terraform, set your kube config as described above.
Install mondoo-operator via an Integration command.
Now you can run the integration tests of the current branch against EKS by executing:
```bash
EXTERNAL_INSTALLATION=1 K8S_DISTRO=eks VERSION=<latest-tag> make test/integration
```

## Known issues

A refresh of the cluster state might error for the aws_auth config map.

## Passing CIS

To pass the CIS benchmark, you have to delete the default Pod Security Policy:
