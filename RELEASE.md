# Releasing helm chart

Mondoo Operator helm chart has been autogenerated using the [helmify](https://github.com/arttor/helmify) tool. The CI uses [chart-releaser-action](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action) to self host the charts using github pages.

The following steps need to be followed to release helm chart.

## Requirements

1. Update Chart.yaml in the charts/mondoo-operator repository with the latest appVersion.
2. Update Chart.yaml in the charts/mondoo-operator repository with the corresponding version.

# Helm Chart Release Workflow

Helm chart release action is executed on every push to main . It checks each chart in the charts folder, and whenever there's a new chart version, creates a corresponding GitHub release named for the chart version, adds Helm chart artifacts to the release, and creates or updates an index.yaml file with metadata about those releases, which is then hosted on GitHub Pages.

# Release process to operatorhub.io

The following steps sets are necessary to release the operator to operatorhub.io

## Preconditions:

- `operator-sdk`

## Release process

1. Generate bundle

```bash
make bundle IMG="ghcr.io/mondoohq/mondoo-operator:v0.0.10" VERSION="0.0.10"
```

This target generates a `/bundle` directory with manifests and metadata.

2. Cross repo PR to https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators

fork https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators

In the forked repo add the following files from the `/bundle` directory:

- bundle/manifests/k8s.mondoo.com_mondooauditconfigs.yaml
- bundle/manifests/mondoo-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml

and update the `operators/mondoo-operator/mondoo-operator.package.yaml` to point to latest version of the operator.

commit and do a cross repo PR.

**I want to run tests locally before commiting**
