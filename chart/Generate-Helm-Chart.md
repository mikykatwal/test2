# Generate Helm Chart
The helm chart has been generated using the [helmify](https://github.com/arttor/helmify) tool.
> Please do not edit templates manually as any changes done to the templates will be overwritten automatically upon the next generation using helmify.

# Command to Run
Run `make helm`from the root folder of the repository to generate the helm chart.

> chart.yaml is only generated once and will not be updated by helmify.
