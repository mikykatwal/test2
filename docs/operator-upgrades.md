# Upgrade the Mondoo Operator

The Mondoo Operator version numbers are expressed as `x.y.z`, where `x` is the major version, `y` is the minor version, and `z` is the patch version, following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standards. Our release approach ensures there are no breaking changes between two adjacent minor versions. For example, you can upgrade the Mondoo Operator from `v1.2.15` to `v1.3.0` without any manual actions. The Mondoo Operator automatically executes any required migration and/or cleanup steps.

You can upgrade the Mondoo Operator from major version to major version as long as each major version is visited during the upgrade. For example, if you are on version 1.3.2 and want to upgrade to version 3.0.5, you should first upgrade to a 2.y.z release to ensure any migrations that need to take place from 1.x to 2.x are completed before upgrading to 3.x. Jumping from any 1.x to any 2.x is a safe operation.

**WARNING: Never try to upgrade the Mondoo Operator by simply changing the tag for the Mondoo Operator container image.**

## Update a manually deployed operator

Follow these steps for a smooth Mondoo Operator upgrade:

1. Verify the Mondoo Operator version currently running in the cluster:
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployment -n mondoo-operator mondoo-operator-controller-manager -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
   ```
2. Check the latest version of the Mondoo Operator on our [Releases](https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator/releases/latest) GitHub page.

Based on the version difference between your Mondo Operator and the latest release, follow the steps below.

### If your current Mondoo Operator is no more than one minor version behind

If there is **not** more than one major version difference between the installed Mondoo Operator and the latest release, apply the latest manifest to the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator/releases/latest/download/mondoo-operator-manifests.yaml
```

### If your current Mondoo Operator is more than one major version behind

If there **is** more than one major version difference between the installed Mondoo Operator and the latest release, you must apply the manifest files for each major version between the two versions. For example, if the version installed is `v1.2.0` and the latest version is `v3.4.3`, you must install you must install a x2.x release. Follow these steps:

1. Apply the manifest for the version you skipped, such as `v2.0.0`:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator/releases/v2.0.0/download/mondoo-operator-manifests.yaml
   ```
2. Wait until the new version of the Mondoo Operator is running and verify there are no errors in the operator log:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n mondoo-operator deployment/mondoo-operator-controller-manager
   ```

   It's essential to check the logs and wait for the new version of the operator to run; directly upgrading to the next version can result in skipped internal upgrade procedures and unexpected behavior.

   Check the `Status.ReconciledByOperatorVersion` field of your `MondooAuditConfig` to be sure the new operator version reconciled every object:

   ```bash
   kubectl get mondooauditconfigs.k8s.mondoo.com -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.status.reconciledByOperatorVersion}{"\n"}{end}' -A | uniq
   ```

   The version of your running Mondoo Operator and the version in the `Status` field must be the same before you proceed.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for every major release between your version and the latest release. You must install each major version independently, waiting between each update to verify that the version installed properly and the log is error free.

4. Apply the manifest for the latest version, such as `v3.4.3`:
   `bash kubectl apply -f https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator/releases/latest/download/mondoo-operator-manifests.yaml 

## Update an operator deployed with Helm

To update your operator installed with Helm, you have two options:

- Upgrade the Helm chart to the [latest release](https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator/releases/latest)
- Update the [values](https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator/blob/main/charts/mondoo-operator/values.yaml#L17) for the Helm chart to the latest image tag which matched the latest Helm chart release.
  You can also find it [here](https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator/pkgs/container/mondoo-operator/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged)

## Update an OLM installation

1. List the subscriptions:

   ```bash
   kubectl get subscription -n mondoo-operator
   ```

2. Delete the Mondoo Operator subscription:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete sub -n mondoo-operator mondoo-operator-v0-7-1-sub
   ```

3. Delete the Mondoo Operator cluster service version:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete csv -n mondoo-operator mondoo-operator.v0.7.1
   ```

4. Install the latest Mondoo Operator version using the standard OLM installation command.
